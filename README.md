# hello-world
Hello!
This is a test repository where I am playing with HTML5 and CSS3. Maybe in the future I will add JavaScript code to it.
Till then I am going to add main parts of both HTML and CSS to these documents. It will undoubtedly make them overflown and hard to read, but the goal is making a playground. And as I said before I am going to execute only main features of aforementioned technologies.
